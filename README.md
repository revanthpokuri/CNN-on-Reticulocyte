# CNN-on-Reticulocyte
In a collection of photographs of cat blood smears, we wanted to train a neural network to find the ratio of aggregate reticulocytes to punctate reticulocytes and erythrocytes. This was carried out by training a convolutional neural network to recognize 2D objects in camera photos. This means that for a given image, the network should output the locations of all objects of interest within the image as a rectangular bounding box around each detected object showing the object's location, a classification label showing what object the bounding box has, and a confidence score showing how confident the model is about the respective prediction.

This dataset has images and labels of feline reticulocytes an immature red blood cell without a nucleus, having a granular or reticulated appearance when suitably stained. The dataset was created using equipment that is easily accessible to veterinarians: a standard laboratory microscope and two types of cameras: a basic microscope camera and a smartphone camera.
